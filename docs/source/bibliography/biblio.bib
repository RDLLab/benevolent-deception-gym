    abstract = {A general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined In terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with micro-scopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the "politeness factor." The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the Intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lanechanging rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density.},
