Human Testing
=============

Here we provide some details on the method employed for testing the BDGym environments with human users.

We use a similar testing protocol to that employed by :cite:p:`mnih2015human`. Specifically, for each environment and configuration human testers are given a practice period before running the tests for a fixed number of episodes. We used a practice period of X min before testing for 10 episodes.
